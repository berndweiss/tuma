Description: This package provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to
    visualize univariate fixed effect (FEM) and random effects model (REM)
    meta-analysis. By interactively manipulating effect sizes and standard
    errors, it is possible to better understand their relationship with summary
    (FEM and REM) and heterogeneity related statistics (Q, I^2 and tau^2).
    Additionally, two plots are created which show a typical forest plot as
    well as a density plot with N(hat{theta}, tau^2). These plots also
    change if the individual effects sizes or standard errors are manipulated.
    This work was supported by a fellowship within the "Postdoc-Programme" of
    the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).
